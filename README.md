1.	Problem Statement
Businesses receive thousands of reviews for ChatGPT on platforms like Google Play Store. Manually analyzing this feedback to identify user concerns, feature requests, and satisfaction trends is challenging. A lack of automated insights can delay improvements and impact user experience.

2.	Proposed Solution
This project will develop a sentiment analysis application that automates review classification (positive, neutral, negative) and extracts key themes (e.g., "response speed," "accuracy"). By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, businesses can gain valuable insights to enhance ChatGPT’s performance.

2. Project Description
Objective
To build a sentiment analysis tool that:
•	Classifies ChatGPT reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
•	Extracts key themes (e.g., "coding help," "response accuracy").
•	Visualizes trends to track sentiment changes over time or across app versions.
Business Relevance
This tool will help:
•	Businesses understand user satisfaction and identify pain points.
•	Developers prioritize improvements based on real user feedback.
•	Track sentiment shifts across different app updates.

Technical Implementation
NLP Techniques: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stop word removal, NER, TF-IDF, Word2Vec
ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, BERT (if applicable)
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
